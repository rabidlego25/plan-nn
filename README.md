# Neural ODE Framework for Classical Trajectories

This project implements a Neural ODE framework to simulate and learn dynamical systems, with a specific application to planetary motion. It uses PyTorch and the `torchdiffeq` library to solve ODEs and train models for trajectory prediction.

## Features
- Simulate planetary motion using numerical ODE solvers.
- Train Neural ODE models for trajectory prediction.
- Save and visualize results using Matplotlib.
- Modular code structure for scalability and reusability.
